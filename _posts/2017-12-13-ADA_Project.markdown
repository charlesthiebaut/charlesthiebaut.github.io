In this project we explore the evolution of the Swiss energy during roughly 100 years and determine the velocity of the energy transition. The goal is to understand how the energy consumption evolved during a set period and analyse whether the energetic transition is on its way or not. Another objective is to allow a lambda user to play with the data and display only the sources he is interested in. This easy informative tool shows straightforward insight into the Swiss energetic climate and its past evolutions.
