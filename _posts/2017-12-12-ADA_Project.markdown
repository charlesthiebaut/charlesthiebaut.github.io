In this project we explore the evolution of the Swiss energy during roughly 100 years and determine the rate of the energy transition. The goal is to understand how the energy consumption evolved during a set period and analyse whether the energetic transition is on its way or not. <br>Please find below an easy informative and pedagogic tool that shows straightforward insight into the Swiss energetic climate and its past evolutions. 

This first graph shows the percentage of each energy source in Switzerland over the years. Checkboxes on the top lets you choose between them. By clicking on one curve you will get more detail on the production of energy coming from that source in Switzerland. Information includes maps, images as well as textual description of that source in Switzerland.  <br>

In the second graph energy is measured  inâ€¦

To summarise all the texts accessible through clicks on the different energy curves, this study showed that Switzerland energy sources have shifted over the year. <br>Coal consumption was, during the first have of last century the first source of energy of Switzerland, it uses has now nearly disappeared. Oil, that replaced coal in the second half of the 1900, looks to be following the same path with new energies sources being introduced. Moreover this studies shows that Switzerland still relies heavily on nuclear power, most of it been imported. This percentage unlike the other non renewable energy doesn't have a downward trend and means that fossil energy is still highly used in the country. <br>Hydraulic remains the main type of renewable energy produced in Switzerland, with consumption from this source going as back as 1910 ! . However with the rapid economical development and although many  dams have been made, the country was't able increase its percentage of hydraulic energy over the years. New forms of renewable energy are growing (mainly wind powered) although limited amount of data meant that we weren't able to have stronger conclusion.<br>

Future looks however promising for Switzerland energy production as well as consumption. The future close of all nuclear plants mean that the country has develop new energy production sources if it doesn't want to rely on its neighbours imports. Such investments are being made in the wind power and solar industry, with increasing number of cantons giving subsidy to individuals willing to install solar panel on their house roof for example.
